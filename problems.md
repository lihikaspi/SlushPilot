## Problems Observed (Query Letter Output vs. Tiffany Hawk Format)

- Missing targeted reason for the agent/publisher in the opening (no personalization).
- Opening is formulaic and lacks a humanized lead-in.
- Story section is too short compared to the 1–2 paragraph guidance.
- Summary does not clearly surface protagonist, goal, and stakes.
- Few specific details that make the story feel unique or vivid.
- Bio is overly long and not tightly focused on credentials.
- Closing does not mention submission materials or attachments when relevant.
- Overall structure still feels template-driven rather than naturally written.
