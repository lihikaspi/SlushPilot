Dear [Agent Name],

I am seeking representation for my 75,000-word YA horror novel, ALL FOR GLORY. It blends the small-town hauntings and summer friendships of DARK AND SHALLOW LIES with the haunted lake atmosphere of THE GIRLS ARE NEVER GONE.

Sixteen-year-old Iris Garren returns to her family's cabin in Bad Creek a year after her sister Glory drowned. The lake is full of memories, but the summer is hollow without the sister who led every tradition. When Iris sleepwalks to an abandoned house and finds it in her sister's journal alongside sketches of Hudson Clavey, the town's golden boy, she begins to suspect Glory's death was not an accident.

Iris has one week before her family leaves. Her best friends keep secrets, Hudson may know more than he admits, and Iris wakes each morning closer to the water's edge. If she cannot uncover what happened last summer, she may become Bad Creek's next girl to drown.

ALL FOR GLORY is inspired by my family's summers in northern Michigan. As a queer author, it was important to me to center queer teens who challenge nostalgia and tradition. In 2023, I won the Write Team Mentorship contest and revised this manuscript with my mentors.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Peyton June Leatherman
