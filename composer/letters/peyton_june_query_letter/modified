Dear Acquisitions Team,

I am seeking representation for my YA horror novel, ALL FOR GLORY, complete at 75,000 words. I am querying you because you represent dark, character-driven YA with atmospheric stakes.

Sixteen-year-old Iris Garren returns to her family's cabin in Bad Creek a year after her sister Glory drowned. The lake is full of memories, but the summer is hollow without the sister who led every tradition. When Iris sleepwalks to an abandoned house and finds it in her sister's journal alongside sketches of Hudson Clavey, the town's golden boy, she begins to suspect Glory's death was not an accident.

Iris has one week before her family leaves. Her best friends keep secrets, Hudson may know more than he admits, and Iris wakes each morning closer to the water's edge. If she cannot uncover what happened last summer, she may become Bad Creek's next girl to drown.

ALL FOR GLORY will appeal to readers of DARK AND SHALLOW LIES and THE GIRLS ARE NEVER GONE.

As a queer author, it was important to me to center queer teens who challenge nostalgia and tradition. In 2023, I won the Write Team Mentorship contest and revised this manuscript with my mentors.

Thank you for your time and consideration. The full manuscript is available upon request.

Sincerely,
Peyton June Leatherman
