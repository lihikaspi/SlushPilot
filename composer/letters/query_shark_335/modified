Dear [Agent Name],

I am seeking representation for CHLOE'S ROOF, an 80,200-word work of speculative fiction. I am querying you because you represent literary-leaning speculative stories with psychological stakes.

Chloe Reed hears a static-laced voice every time she looks at a roof. The voice insists she has been chosen to build the only roof that will let her speak to God. Chloe is torn between fearing she is losing her mind and hoping the voice proves she is worthy of love, especially after years of rejection from her father.

She builds the roof on a backyard shed. Inside, the voice speaks to her from above and claims to be God, but this God does not know who Jesus is. The voice wants more than Chloe's faith. It wants her to recruit believers and surrender control. If Chloe resists, she risks losing the only proof she has that she matters. If she obeys, she may become the instrument of something far more dangerous than faith.

CHLOE'S ROOF will appeal to readers of [Comp Title 1] and [Comp Title 2].

I am a debut author living in [City/Region], where I work as [Occupation] and write speculative fiction.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Author Name]
