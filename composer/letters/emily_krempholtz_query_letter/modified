Dear Acquisitions Team,

I am seeking representation for my adult cozy fantasy romance, VIOLET THISTLETHWAITE IS NOT A VILLAIN ANYMORE, complete at 80,000 words. I am querying you because you are looking for cozy fantasy with heart.

Violet spent her whole life serving a ruthless sorcerer, and when he finally falls, she sees a chance to start over. She escapes to Dragon's Rest to open a flower shop, retire her dangerous magic, and keep her sentient (and mildly homicidal) houseplant out of trouble. For the first time, she is building a life that is hers.

Her new beginning is complicated by Nathaniel Marsh, a prickly alchemist who shares her greenhouse and is just as desperate for a second chance. When a mysterious blight threatens the town's gardens, Violet and Nathaniel are forced into an uneasy partnership. If Violet cannot stop the blight and keep her past buried, she risks losing the community she is finally learning to trust.

VIOLET THISTLETHWAITE IS NOT A VILLAIN ANYMORE will appeal to readers of LEGENDS & LATTES, THE UNDERTAKING OF HART AND MERCY, and EMILY WILDE'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FAERIES.

I am a bestselling ghostwriter, editor, and award-winning book coach who has supported hundreds of authors across genres. I live in Denver, Colorado.

Thank you for your time and consideration. The full manuscript is available upon request.

Sincerely,
Emily Krempholtz
