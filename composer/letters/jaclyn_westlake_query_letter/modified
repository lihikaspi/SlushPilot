Dear Acquisitions Team,

I am seeking representation for my women's fiction novel, DEAR DOTTY, complete at 83,000 words. I am querying you because you mentioned interest in stories about twenty-something life and family expectations.

Rosie has spent years trying to fit into her overachieving family, her type-A roommate, and her image-obsessed job. When she gets fired from a tree-themed tech startup, the plan she has built her life around collapses. Her great-aunt Dotty, a globetrotting, martini-swilling nudist and the only person Rosie has ever felt truly understood by, dares her to pursue a dream she buried long ago.

Then Dotty dies. As Rosie grieves, she receives a series of emails revealing a side of Dotty she never knew. The revelations push Rosie to question every safe choice she has made, including the ones that kept her close to home. To move forward, Rosie must decide whether to follow Dotty's path or finally choose one of her own.

DEAR DOTTY will appeal to readers of MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE, CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC, and THE STAR-CROSSED SISTERS OF TUSCANY.

I completed Stanford Continuing Studies' novel writing program, am an active member of the Women's Fiction Writers Association, and regularly participate in workshops and critique groups. My short story, A RUNAWAY TALE, received the Story Shares Character Award. I also write career topics for The Muse and have been featured in Fast Company, Forbes, and Business Insider.

Thank you for your time and consideration. The full manuscript is available upon request.

Warmly,
Jaclyn Westlake
