Dear [Agent Name],

I am seeking representation for my YA contemporary novel, WHERE THE WATER MEETS THE SKY, complete at 85,000 words. I am querying you because you represent voice-driven YA with emotional stakes.

Eighteen-year-old Taryn has one rule: don't get involved. She learned it after her best friend Stella died by suicide four summers ago. But when her father moves overseas, Taryn has no choice but to return to the Jersey Shore and the people she left behind.

Back home, she falls into a job at a seaside restaurant and runs into Adam, the boy she once loved. The more time she spends with him, the more she remembers about the summer Stella died. Then a new coworker hints at secrets that do not match the story everyone believes. To find the truth, Taryn must confront the guilt she has carried for years and risk the fragile relationships she has rebuilt.

WHERE THE WATER MEETS THE SKY will appeal to readers who enjoyed the group dynamics of ON THE JELLICOE ROAD and the grief-driven coming-of-age of THE SEA OF TRANQUILITY.

When I am not writing, I work as a social media director. This is my debut novel.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
MK Pagano
