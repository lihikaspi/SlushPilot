Dear Acquisitions Team,

Your list’s interest in intimate, character-driven tales that blend gentle magic with emotional stakes makes this manuscript a strong fit; readers who loved the warm communities and tender relationships in Legends & Lattes and The Undertaking of Hart and Mercy should find this work resonant.

I'm hoping you will consider my Speculative Literary Fiction novel, The Glass Orchard, complete at 93,000 words.

After a citywide blackout reveals a hidden orchard that only appears at night, a grieving urban planner must decide whether to expose the phenomenon or protect the community that has grown around it

Set against an urban landscape that feels both familiar and uncanny, the novel examines how loss reshapes civic duty and private life. The planner’s conflict between disclosure and protection forces conversations about stewardship, belonging, and the quiet economies that sustain vulnerable communities.

The Glass Orchard will appeal to readers of Legends & Lattes and The Undertaking of Hart and Mercy because of its shared genre and tonal style.
